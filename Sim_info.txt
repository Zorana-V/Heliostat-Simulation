; Background on the SORCE-SIM Spectral Irradiance Measurements
; 
; The SORCE-SIM Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) data products are provided on
; a fixed wavelength scale which varies in spectral resolution from 1-34 nm over
; the entire spectral range. Irradiances are reported at a mean solar distance
; of 1 AU and zero relative line-of-sight velocity with respect to the Sun.
; 
; As a separate data product, a composite SORCE SSI using the XPS, SOLSTICE and
; SIM instruments, covering 0.1-2412.3 nm, is also delivered daily to
; http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data/sorce_ssi_l3/.

; DATA QUALITY and IRRADIANCE UNCERTAINTY are reported in V27. MISSING data have
; values of 0.0000e+00 for both IRRADIANCE and IRRADIANCE UNCERTAINTY. UV data 
; before mission day 800 (yyyymmdd = 20050403) in the 306-310 nm bandpass are
; treated as MISSING due to potential saturaton. All IR (950-1600 nm) IRRADIANCE
; UNCERTAINTY values are set to 2.5000e-04. See the SORCE-SIM V27 release notes 
; for justification and further details.
; 
; The spectral irradiances are tabulated below ("DATA RECORDS"), with each
; row giving the nominal date, the wavelength band, the SORCE-SIM instrument
; mode, the data version, the spectral irradiance, its 1-sigma uncertainty,
; and a "quality" measure--the average of the time differences (in days)
; between the nominal date and the measurement times. Each field (column)
; is defined and described in the "DATA DEFINITIONS" above. An IDL file reader
; (http://lasp.colorado.edu/data/sorce/file_readers/read_lasp_ascii_file.pro)
; is available which will read this file and return an array of structures whose
; field names and types are taken from the "DATA DEFINITIONS" section.
